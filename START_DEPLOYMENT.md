## üîí Security Notes

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- Private keys only in Railway backend
- Public anon key in Vercel frontend
- Environment files gitignored
- HTTPS enabled by default

**‚ö†Ô∏è To Fix:**
- Remove CORS wildcard "*" in `backend/main.py` line 34
- Replace with your Vercel domain after deployment

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Backend Tests (Railway)
```bash
# 1. Health check
curl https://[railway-url]/

# 2. API docs
curl https://[railway-url]/docs

# 3. Check specific endpoint
curl https://[railway-url]/dashboard/stats
```

### Frontend Tests (Vercel)
1. Visit `https://[vercel-url]`
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Check Console for errors
4. Try uploading an invoice
5. Check if it appears in dashboard

### Integration Test
1. Upload invoice via Vercel
2. Check Supabase dashboard for new data
3. Try chat feature with uploaded invoice
4. Verify dashboard shows statistics
